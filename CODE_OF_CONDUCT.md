# Code of Conduct

version: 2021-03-10

## Essentials

 * Be friendly and patient: Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
 * Be welcoming: Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
 * Be respectful: We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:
   * Violent threats or language.
   * Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
   * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
   * Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
   * Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
   * Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
   * Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
 * Understand Disagreements: Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.
 * This Code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the Code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all repos related to the Project regardless of whether or not the repo explicitly calls out its use of this Code of Conduct. The Code also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing the Project or its community. Examples include using an official Project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the Project may be further defined and clarified by Project maintainers or administrators.

## Reporting Code of Conduct Issues

We encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier interaction. In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please feel free to report your concerns by contacting the project maintainers, project administrators, or a designated arbiter.

In your report please include:

 * Your contact information.
 * Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
 * Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public chat log), please include a link or attachment.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the review team may take any action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.

Ultimately if arbitration by the administration yields an unsatisfactory outcome for any parties then a voluntary departure from the Project may be the best course of action.
